"11","Jay","Fain","7063029404","jay.fain@milliken.com","Hello,
   My name is Jay Fain.  I have been looking for a tractor/loader for a few years.  I currently have a John Deere 820 1972 utility tractor with no loader and get by.  We use it about 80 hours per year on 25 acres.  I would like some advice from someone who knows tractors far better than I do.  The reasons for wanting a loader tractor are:
1.  I purchase hay from a nearby barn.  It is stacked three and four bales high.  Currently, I have to climb the hay, tie a strap on it, and pull it over so that I can get a bale with my three point hitch.  I am 54 now and my sons are leaving home, so this isn't a good solution long term.  Also, I get fertilize and feed on one ton pallets.  We usually go get four tons at a time with a long bed F350 and a trailer.  Unloading two tons out of the truck bed and two tons off the trailer by hand is also getting old.  I would like to be able to have forks on the tractor that could reach to the back of the truck bed and pick up a ton pallet.  Then, I could drive it into the barn/shed without having to handle every bag manually.  Moving dirt and mulch once in a while to control erosion would also be helpful.  Of course, mowing, bush hogging, plowing gardens, pulling box blades to level driveway gravel, digging post holes, and other farm chores could also be done by this tractor if the 820 is down or in use elsewhere.  I doubt this machine gets much more than 50-100 hours per year, but it could keep my hobby farm operational as I grow older.  Currently, I am led to believe that a JD 5425 pre-emission tractor, 12/12 Power Reverser, open station, 3rd function for grapple (we have to pick up debris for fires to keep the place clean occasionally), with bucket, forks, hay spear, and grapple would be the best tractor for me to purchase.  However, my Uncle recommends a Kubota M7040HD with similar setup.  Could you provide some feedback?  Do you believe this is a good choice, or do you recommend something else?

Thanks,

Jay
