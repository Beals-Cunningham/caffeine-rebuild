The AU College of Veterinary Medicine is going to be participating in the Auburn Christmas Parade again this year. Last year, SunSouth was very generous and allowed us to use one of your tractors for the parade. I was wondering if you thought we might be able to borrow one again for the parade this year. The date and time for the parade is Sunday, December 9 at 2:00pm. 

Thanks so much!

"22","Fred","Sargeant","309-712-5416","at1.retired@gmail.com","I recently dealt with your parts department for the first time, and I have to say, it was - and still is - a very poor experience.

On my first visit, around 29 April, I ordered a set of front and rear wheel weights for a JD E170 Lawn Tractor.  Before ordering them I asked how difficult it would be to install them and the lady at the counter assured me they are easily installed by the owner because the wheels already have mounting holes in them.  Basically you just bolt them on with the two included bolts.  Same story for both front and rear.

The first problem came up when my order arrived on 1 May (I think).  The girl had ordered two sets of rear weights and neglected to order the mounting bolts for the front weights.  So I left one set of rear weights at the store and ordered the mounting bolts for the front.  I pointed out to her that I only had a couple of days and would be out-of-state starting Sunday, 5 May.  She assured me the bolts would be in on Thursday, 2 May, and that she would call me when they arrived.  Today is 13 May and I still haven't received a call.

So I gave up waiting on your parts department and bought 4 bolts from my local hardware store so I could get the weights installed before leaving on my trip.  It took only seconds for me to discover that there are no existing holes in the wheels.  So not only could I not mount the weights before leaving, the lady at the parts counter literally got every single aspect of this transaction wrong.

So here's where things stand...
1.  I have a set of front and rear weights I can't install
2.  I ordered a set of mounting bolts for the front and have yet to hear from anybody that they came in.
3. You still owe me a credit for the extra set of rear weights.  The lady said she take care of that when I came in to pick up the front bolts.

I am now on business travel and likely will not be back in Alabama until the end of the month.
1.  What is it going to cost me to get these weights installed - even though I was told I could easily install them myself?
2.  What is the status of front bolts I ordered?
3.  What do I need to do finalize this issue and get the cost of the extra rear weights credited back to my card?","1557769171","true","new",
