The Debi DeHass Memorial Barrel race is to commemorate the life of an extraordinary horse woman. All proceeds from the race will go to her daughter, Shelby, who was left to take care of the farm and livestock when Debi passed unexpectedly earlier this year. We would love for SunSouth to team up with us for this event and be a sponsor. I would be happy to send you a sponsorship form if you're interested. Thank you and have a wonderful day.

I was planning on purchasing a 3025e package with the following items: front end loader, box blade, rotary cutter and a 3 point fertilizer spreader. I will be putting a down payment of $1500. Is a personal check okay? Would it be possible to get an updated price list so I can figure out what my monthly payments will be? This purchase is planned for the middle to end of May. 
Also, what will I need to bring with me when I come to purchase the tractor? I have already done business with Sunsouth Andalusia but that was in 2016. Thank you for your time ","1619376555","true","new",
