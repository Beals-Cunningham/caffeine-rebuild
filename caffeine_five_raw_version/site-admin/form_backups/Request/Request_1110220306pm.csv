Do you have any at your facility I could test drive? Would they have the same features, or is it a generic version?

Im interested in the 0% for 72 months. Can you please send me a quote (include any fees/taxes/etc) along with any other incentives Sunsouth or JD may be offering? What is the current lead time for this tractor? Are they in stock or would it need to be built at the factory first? If i needed/wanted to have the tractor delivered, what is an estimated cost? I'm roughly 32 miles away.

My name is Jim Kitchel, I own Entaurus Capital in Dewey, OK. The reason I’m writing to you is we are buying up oil wells from producers in your area and I was wondering if you would be interested in selling some of yours. We offer between $43K-$77K BOPD. The current oil boom probably won’t last. The darn “Green New Deal” might really hurt us. Would it be out of line to make you an offer? Want to partner on a joint venture? Let’s talk. Email me back if you are interested, my email is Oilgasconsolidation@gmail.com If I don’t make you an offer, maybe I can just make a new friend. :) Jim 918-214-9201

Since I would be paying cash, what would be the total, bottom-line number for the equipment? Can also be gently used.

I had emailed Schlagel Manufacturing about the individual price for 2 or maybe 3 RT-1000 units and potentially the cost of a draw bar. Jonathan Spence with Schlagel responded and told me to reach out to y'all and that you may be able to help.

Look forward to hearing from you,
