Thank you for sending me “The Furrow” and its predecessor publication.  Please put someone else on the distribution list.  This young lady kept her honey bees on my farm and helped me several times.  I saw first hand her intellect, her love for the earth, artistic abilities, etc.  She drove most of the John Deere tractors I have owned and as a result, she developed a desire to work for John Deere.  Emmie Ruth Wise, is currently a senior at Georgia Technical Institute majoring in Industrial Design.  She has a love for farm life, John Deere tractors and equipment.  Emmie Ruth Wise mailing address, while she is in school is her parents home at:  7917 Edenburgh Ct.,
