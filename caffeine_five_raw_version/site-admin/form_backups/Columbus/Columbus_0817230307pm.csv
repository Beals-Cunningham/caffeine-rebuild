I have a service question about a 3029TF270 engine and the fuel pump. I am aware of the requirement to place the manual prime lever against the engine block when done priming. After the last fuel
filter change, the engine now takes a bit longer to start, then varies rpm just after starting for about 5-10 seconds and then runs steady. When stopped and left for a while, the manual priming will move fuel along the system, almost as if the fuel is draining backward out of the line and into the tank. Is it possible the fuel pump has gone bad, and needs to be replaced?

Thanks,
