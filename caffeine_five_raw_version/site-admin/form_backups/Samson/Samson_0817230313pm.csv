I have been compact tractor shopping and have been offered a New Massey-Ferguson 1739E w/MF L105E Loader, 38 HP, 4-WD, Gear Transmission with R-4 Tires on a trailer with 5 foot bush hog For 24k out the door.... I had checked with sun south but not locally ( I live in gaskin fla.) So here's where my delima is........ my wife really wants me to have a green tractor but the previous quote I got from sun south was a higher than what massey is offering, everyone says I need to talk to yall.... so with all that being said I guess my question is can JD match or beat that offer..... please understand I have been shopping so I have a pretty good idea on fair market value across the big brands but I didn't want to purchase without giving yall the opportunity to earn my business..... I would like to see what yall can do.... thank you and have a blessed day.....","1599082033","true","new",

Just a note to say thanks, I appreciate ya'll so very much for all the work Sun South has provided to me as a happy John Deere customer/owner. I have had the opportunity to work with Cliff both as a service manager and in the sales department. In the service department he was an absolute God sent. He has continued to provide excellent customer support in both roles putting me at ease and keeping me in the communication fold. Even when I was indecisive he explained every detail of my repair on previous equipment and with my new purchase transactions in detail to be sure I was in the loop. He suggested preventions and standards to insure the tractors best performance and life. 
I'm so proud of my 2021 John Deere 5054e.  Thanks to ya”ll but especially to Cliff for taking the extra care and time from our first meeting to following-up after my initial service call with Sun South. I hope we’ll have a long productive relationship.  
Best Regards,
Rose Piazza

I thought I cancelled some of these parts but obviously not. When I ordered it stated that the bill would be charged to my JD financial account, NOT my credit card. I will take the parts this time. But for future reference you can CEASE AND DESIST on using my American Express card without my authorization. Please refrain from EVER using this card again. "IF" I ever place another order with you in the future I will call it in where at that time I will give you a credit card to charge it to. Thanks","1659380402","true","new",
