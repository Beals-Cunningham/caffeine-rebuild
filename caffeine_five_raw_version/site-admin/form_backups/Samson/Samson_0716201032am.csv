Purchased- 10 June 2019
Price- $24,875.49

13 Jun 2019—Monitor displays erroneous fault code with every Bale
SunSouth adjusted monitor .
29 Aug 2019 - Bale Kickers contacting Belts and Metal Net Wrap Pan
SunSouth Adjusted but still contacts.  Adjustment resulted in Net Wrap Pan being bent and scraped, Also in Net Wrap ripping.  SunSouth Pryed Net Wrap Channels and got Net Wrap Ripping stopped.
2 Sep 2019- Net Wrap would not Stop Feeding.	
	I cut Net Wrap out of Baler for 8 Hours.
	SunSouth Adjusted Net Wrap Brake. Also had to reset Monitor for Net Wrap Knife to actuate.
8 Sep 2019 – Net Wrap Belt Broke. Caused by guide not being tightened.
	SunSouth Took to shop and Replaced Belt.
10 Sep 2019- Baler dropped in field. I was not informed it was repaired.  Net Wrap ripped on all Bales. I tried to pry out like SunSouth but could not.
I Contacted the sellsman at SunSouth and stated: The baler was not acceptable as a new baler.  The bale Kickers are still contacting even when I apply hydraulics slowly.  The Net Wrap plate is still damaged and is ripping the net Wrap.  The entire baler needs to be checked and adjusted as it should have been when purchased. I expect this done in two weeks so I can complete the 2019 hay season.  Or Get me a new Baler OR provide a full refund.  Since I submitted this last Wed, 11 Sep 2019, and haven’t received a response other than I need to talk to my manager, I am submitting to you.  I will deliver the baler to SunSouth 18 Sep 2019 fot resolution.
