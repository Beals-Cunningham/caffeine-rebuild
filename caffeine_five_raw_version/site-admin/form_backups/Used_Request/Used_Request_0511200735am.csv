I guess what I'm asking - is how much to trade?  Foley is 200-225 miles away.

I need a good tractor for working on my 5.5 acres. My questions are: does this compact (Stock #: 245435) come with the brush-cutter and the drive over cut deck? Does it have the connections for a bucket in the front and a back-hoe for the back? Please forgive my ignorance. I just need a good tractor that will have me work my land for at or under $15K. Do you have anything on the yard that might work for me? I also have excellent credit but would rather not accumulate a huge monthly payment and also avoid a large sum of interest payment. Thanks for helping me figure this out. If one of the other tractor dealers in the area might have something closer to what I'm looking for, please let me know if you are allowed!

Does the $16k price include the rotary cutter and loader?  Also, I see a note that says this tractor is new.  Does that mean that this machine would qualify for the 0% for 60 month financing option?

I’ve been in need of a riding mower/zero turn, Atleast used. I’ve had back problems since I was in 4th grade and it’s hard to use my push mower I have and lift it into the bed of the truck. I don’t have much money that I can throw around. It’s hard doing yards with a push mower and I need something better. Please email me back.","1577222116","true","new",
