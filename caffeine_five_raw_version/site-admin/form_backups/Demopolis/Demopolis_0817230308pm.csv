I just reviewed your company's profile, very impressive. As the leading middle-market investment banking firm, Generational Group (generational.com) is committed to helping business owners with effective growth strategies, and ultimately the right exit strategy, when the timing is appropriate. If you would like to explore ways to implement a dynamic growth plan to scale the business, or would be interested in learning what is currently happening in the M&A market in your industry, we should schedule a time to talk directly. 

Just as a matter of information, know that we are being approached directly by well-capitalized private equity buyers and strategic growth partners actively looking for companies in your space.

If an introductory phone call makes sense, let me know a time that works for you and I will make myself available.

Very best,

Steve
