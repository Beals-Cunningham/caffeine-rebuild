My dirt road is being repaired in the morning so have them call me please before they get to Lillian and I will drive the tractor out to West Carrier Drive at the end of Fox Lane and they can load it there, much easier.

"5","Samuel ","Derusha ","6014801723","bulldogdan13@yahoo.com","Ok, this is a mixed message . Service was top notch at the store and the people are great but the product I purchased not so much. I got it home in Meridian after a 2.75 hr drive home and realized the front right tire was flat , no biggie at first , aired it up , unloaded the tractor, dropped the bish jig after making a few test passes with it . All was well. Tested my loader, all worked well, dropped the bush hog took my disk off the trailer with rope and bucket all still well . Backed up tot she disk hooked it up made a couple test passes and it worked great. I did the 3 pt hitch , drive away fri disk and when backing up to put the tractor up I realize that the lifter in the 3 pt on the left side was hanging down on the ground . Got off looked and the bolt was broken off inside the top left housing, I’ve owned the tractor less than 24 hrs and already two things have happened one, the tire before I even cranked it. I’m quit disappointed with that to say the least . Brendan and Thomas were awesome sales people and the help
In the yard loading it up was awesome too but it seems the tractor is well below the standards of the sustainer service I received . It isn’t feasible for me to tow it back and forth a bunch caisenits so far I was hoping for a product that I wouldn’t have to have I. The shop other than normal maintenance stuff . Now that bolt will have to be drilled, extracted and likely retapped ? I was excited about this 3038E now I can’t say that dragging on the ground while nothing was attached to it at all . Can y’all make this right for me  In the nearest future ? Thank you ! ","1550967091","true","new",

I am reaching out to local businesses for support of the Foley High School Football Team.  During the offseason, the parents are hard at work looking for local businesses such as yours to partner with our team. Our football media guide is placed in the hands of hundreds of patrons every Friday during our home games. Some of our sponsorship packages even allow for advertisement to be done on our jumbotron during the games. We appreciate everything the community has done and continues to do to support our program. We wouldn't be where we are without the support of so many wonderful businesses. Please consider becoming one of our business sponsors. I am attaching a form that details the ad program should you decide to become a sponsor. For the ease and convenience of all of our wonderful sponsors, the hyperlinks on the form are all functional. I am available if you have any questions. I will help in any way that I can. 

Thank you and GO LIONS!
