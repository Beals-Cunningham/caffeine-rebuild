I wanted everyone involved to know how much I appreciate your help to get my Z-930M back up and running.  I know everyone needs their stuff fixed "yesterday" but I was really in a bind.  I had a small window to get our lawns groomed to perfection for this weekend's , rehearsal dinner, wedding and baby shower.  It looked like I was out of luck until I called Mark.  The next thing I know Hunter is coming down our driveway to pick up my sick puppy.  He brought it back within 24 hours.  It's always a pleasure to come to your store.  I don't know everyone but I wanted to express my gratitude to anyone involved in this small slice of your overall business.
