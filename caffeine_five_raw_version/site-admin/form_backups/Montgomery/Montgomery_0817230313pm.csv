Mark, 

I finally got someone down here to cut the grass with the JD after being repaired and the maintenance done. 

He went for a few rounds and then the oil filter came off or loosen up and oil went all over the front and the deck. I think some got on all of the belts. 

He tried to put it back on an he put moere oil in it but it came loose again. Daniel is not a mechanic and being almost blind and not ever worked on one of these type oil filters I could not help hem. 
I am use to the old style of just screwing the oil filter on. 

We ended up pushing it back into the barn. 

I will call later this morning and see what you can do. 

Thanks for any help in advance 

Larry

I was able to start it once (it had a rough start) and I ran it for 1 hour. I took a 5 minute break and came back and now it won't start again. I only get an audible click but no cranking. I have adequate oil, fuel tank is full with new fuel, I am aware of the safety cut-out switches and whenever I engage the mower PTO, press the reverse pedal, or release the break I won't get the audible click when trying to start. The battery voltage is around 12.4v across battery terminals. I did find that I get voltage to the starter terminal at any time the mower is turned on (not just while cranking) which I think is odd but I don't have the necessary experience to confirm that it is a problem.","1663507930","true","new",
