On June 21, 2019, your outside service rep came to my home to service my 5425 John Deere tractor to adjust the clutch. The service rep serviced the tractor and informed me the clutch could not be adjusted and that I needed a new one. He quoted me a price of $2,000 to $2,500. On the same day, someone from your facility came out and got the tractor. I received a bill on the service of the tractor on 7-13-19. On 7-18-19, I went to the office and paid the bill of $792.75. At that time my tractor was in the shop disassembled and they were waiting on the clutch, Which everyone knew that I needed on June 21st. I waited until August 5th to check on my tractor. I was told it was complete and ready to be delivered to my home. I’ve called every day since and been told various reasons why it hasn’t been delivered. As of this date, 8-8-19, it has not been delivered. In the last ten years, I have purchased two John Deere tractors, two John Deere riding mowers and various implements. I am pleased with the quality of the equipment, but very disappointed in the service which will make me look for a different product on my next purchase. Sincerely, Curtis Carter","1565308479","true","new",

"21","James","Summerlin","2565410159","JIM.SUMMERLIN@HOTMAIL.COM","I bought a JD z335e from Lowe's that you delivered a year ago. Until just last week it has been running fine. Now it revs up and down without a smooth idle as it did have. at the start of the season I changes air filter, oil filter, oil, and fuel filter. IT ran perfect for several mowing afterward. The only difference is that I has to refill the gas tank. Is this as simple as bad gas or too much water in the gas?
I have a three year warranty, but I'd hate for it to be this simple and not covered.

Thanks for any advice on this!!","1565732182","true","new",

I believe my father (R. E. Sims) purchased both pieces of equipment from your Montgomery dealership, then called Lawn and Leisure, approximately 25 years ago.  The tractor has had several repairs over the past few years and does not run dependably, and my father is no longer able physically able to use it or the rotary cutter.  I would like to know if there is any value left in the equipment that could be put toward trade on a new or used Lawn Tractor or Residential Mower.  If the equipment has lost its trade value or is only valuable for salvage, I would like to know what the cost would be to have it responsibly moved from our property.  We are located about 30 miles west of the Montgomery Airport, just south of U.S. Highway 80.  I would appreciate your advice and recommendation and can provide photos if that would be helpful.

I will never buy another John Deere with a Briggs engine. I am very disappointed in the performance of this motor. It was serviced on its regular intervals. It is now using about 2qts of oil to cut about a 1 acre yard. This engine has never been run hot or out of oil. Nothing but Tuff-Guard oil used in it.
