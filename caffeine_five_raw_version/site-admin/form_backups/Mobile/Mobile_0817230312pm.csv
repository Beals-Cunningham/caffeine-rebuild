"1","Robbie ","Reed","2514029147","rdreed@mcpss.com","I am a physical education teacher and coach at Alba Middle School in Bayou LA Batre. One of my collateral duties is to maintain the sports fields on campus. Our mower just had a catastrophic failure after many years of use. I was hoping that your business would be interested in sponsoring us by donating a new or slightly used commercial zero-turn mower that is capable of mowing 20+ acres of playing fields per week. Thank you for your time in this matter. Any information or help would be much appreciated.
