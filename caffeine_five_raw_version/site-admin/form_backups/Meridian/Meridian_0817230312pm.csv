We purchased one 2013 JD 4730 SPRAYER, SN: 1N04730XPC0023815 from Tripp Blackmon. His email: tblackmon@sunsouth.com , working on 14733 STATE HIGHWAY 59 FOLEY, AL 36535. 

When the machine arrived, there is no screen. This is the necessary part and the machine can’t be used without screen. It should be sold together with the whole machine. 

Confirming with Tripp, he said he didn’t have it for sell. Is it the part of machine? Is it SUNSOUTH’s way of working?? Our customer pay the money to purchase it only for storage?

We bought the whole machine and you sent the machine that we can’t use it. Someone can contact us to solve it? 

Looking for your early reply.

I called John Deere Headquarters and they said this should have been rectified by the parts department because John Deere will take back the belt and issue them credit. The store manager called me obnoxious when all I was trying to do is get my money back for the incorrect part they sold me and that I can not use.
