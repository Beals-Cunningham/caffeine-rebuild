Guess what 3 time, no one came out to ask what I needed. Ok, they are busy. Nope go inside and walk up to the service counter because the young guy on his cell phone standing in his door on his peronal cell phone didnt have time. Ok, I proceed to the service counter two guys ask me what I need. I need to buy a book, i actually said i need to buy a tractor. They said let me get mike........mike .....Mike no mike. I know this is around 4 PM so mike must have left. So, I wander over to the generators and a young sales lady talking to what I assume is a another salesman die to both were in a office. She asked was anyone helping me...I said no. So, I wait for a good 3 minutes now into my 30 minutes there, I had time to walk the entire length of the property looking for what I already knew what I was there to buy. So, like Meridian customer service I left. I will drive to Purvis MS and buy a tractor from a good company. ","1584745555","true","new",
