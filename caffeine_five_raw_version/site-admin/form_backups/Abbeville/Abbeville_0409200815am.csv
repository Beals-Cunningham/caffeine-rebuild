My name is Kody Skiff and I am with Hoo-rag! I just found your lawn mower sales and repair business online and wanted to introduce myself and the Hoo-rag bandana! I have recently seen an uptick in the number of lawn mower companies printing custom Hoo-rag bandanas with us. They are buying them with their logo on them and then giving them to their customers to wear while they are handling their maintenance accounts. The customers love them for their dust and sun protective qualities and the mower companies love that their logo in on them too!

I thought it would be cool if we made some custom Hoo-rag bandanas that you can use to give away to your customers and maybe even sell a few! We can print your logo on them which is a great way to have your customers advertising for you!

Our pricing is as low as $2.00 per unit! If you would like to have a sample sent out, shoot me your address and I will gladly send you one!


Thanks!

"53","Danny","Ingram","334-689-9850","dingram1@yahoo.com","Just dropping a note to thank the guys for the information I got today from them. As we suspected, the solenoid was not working for some reason. I took it out, sprayed with WD-40, tapped it on the end with a dead blow hammer and then on the side, reinstalled it, and the problem was over. A new one evidently for the guys in the shop. The solenoid showed continuity with my meter so it was good. 

I will call Monday morning but for right now it would appear the tractor won't need to go to the shop for repair? Just to refresh, it is my 3025E and was having problems with the PTO not engaging, even though the lights said it was working......even the PTO tach showed it was working. 

Thanks again,
