"6","Jason","Jamison","3345079069","jj.1096@gmail.com","I sincerely hope that this message gets read by the location general manager in Tuscaloosa.  For many years i have owned and operated Stihl power products, mainly chainsaws.  I visited the Sun South in Tuscaloosa today 01/08/2019 and had finally had enough of the lack of courtesy and caring i get when i come in. For a while i was buying my Stihl bars and chains there, and almost bought a saw last January 2018.  I almost bought it there but when i had been in to look and make my final decision, the salesman at the time seemed unconcerned with what i was looking for and really couldnt answer my questions well. I went to another Stihl dealer and bought a $580 saw a week later. 
Today, January 8, 2019 i was about to purchase a second chainsaw (within the last year).  I asked about the saw i wanted and the bar length i wanted. One of the salesman went found the saw but it had a longer bar and chain than i wanted. I checked the display, and no avail. I asked if they would swap the bar and chain set. I was told i could purchase it extra. 
This really set me spinning. I left and will not be back. I am driving to a Stihl Dealer in the Birmingham area in the morning to purchase a Stihl Professional grade saw (that i was wanting to get at your store) .  The dealer in Birmingham area said they had one with an 18" bar and chain but would gladly swap me down to the 16" setup and drop the price accordingly. 
I wanted to know after the last 8 years coming in buying chains and bars, i will not ever be back. I would rather drive to Birmingham area than the 1.5 miles from my house to your dealership. ","1546994559","true","new",
