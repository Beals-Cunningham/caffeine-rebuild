"27","K.","Clements","N/A","ke0547@peoplepc.com","Hello,

I would like to know what the maximum rpm is that a gearcase can be ran at, with John Deere Corn Head grease as a lubricant. Actually I was considering using it in the chaincase on a Snapper rear engine riding mower. The chaincase is the housing mounted on the axle that slides right or left, when changing gears. I know it's not a Deere product, but I was wondering if one of you was familiar enough with the Snapper transaxle setup to understand it. I think Snapper used their own proprietary lubricant in it, when it was built. Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
