I have spent $2000 short of replacing the water pump and radiator to solve the problem but have been told that is the way it is. I would like to have the tractor picked up. Also the diesel gauge does not work properly. I have had all the fluids changed.I am not in a huge hurry but would like the problem solved before spring farming season arrives and you are extremely busy with farmer's needs.

Thanks, John","1579797083","true","new",
