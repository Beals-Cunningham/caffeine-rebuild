My name is Grace Oellig. I am from PA and am looking to move to Jackson Ga in a year. I have been looking to put out feelers in the agriculture industry in GA. I have am currently employed at a Case/NH/Kubota/Krone dealer. I have grown up on a small crop/cattle/swine farm. My family are Deere people and I have some experience with old Deere equipment. My schooling background is in the automotive/diesel industry. I will be traveling to Ga over the new year holiday and wanted to know if I could stop by and put a name with the face. I appreciate your time.
Best Regards,
Grace Oellig
