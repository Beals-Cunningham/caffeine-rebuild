Hello,
	I know with confidence that SunSouth is a major contributor to the community.  As the newly named coach for the George County High School girls basketball team I am excited to be part of the program and wish to begin building immediately.  The program is down right now but we are ready to start building.   With 30+ years in coaching high school I can attest to the value of attending team camps and shootouts.  They may well be the most important summer events for the program.  This is where the foundations of the season and in this case the program will begin--it is where our family begins.  The benefits are on many fronts on and off the court. A camp is highly focused--each player will play at least 3 games per day and some may get 5 games---between games we will work on skill improvement.  A shootout is a one day event with 3-5 games.  The more minutes they compete the better they will become individually and team wise. Off the court, players will be able to find out more about themselves and their role within the team and build confidence in their teammates.  Leaders will be revealed as well as character traits of individual players.  We will find those who are determined to improve and are committed to the team.  This will also provide the opportunity for the team to get to know their new coach, third in three years.
	This group of young ladies has had a difficult year on and off the court, besides covid and the coaching changes there have been multiple serious injuries to key players.  For us to build a program we will need the time and setting team camps will provide to come together as a family.  
With only a couple weeks before summer team camps begin we find ourselves in a bind.  The young ladies are willing to work hard but we do not have enough time to raise the funds necessary to attend team camps and the district is not wealthy. We are asking you to be a sponsor for the program.  Our summer program begins at the end of May.  To cover our expenses it will cost $210 per player and we are planning on 22 players for a total of $4620. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  We will definitely hang a sign with your logo to show appreciation for those who support our program.
Please make checks to: Attention Coach Moore
