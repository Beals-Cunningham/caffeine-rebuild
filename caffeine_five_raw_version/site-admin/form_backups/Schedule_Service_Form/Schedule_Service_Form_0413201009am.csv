I’ve owned it for 1 season and the digital gauge is displaying 100 hour and an hour glass indicating time for a tune up. Do your records show if Mr Vallery had a maintenance policy.   
I feel it needs to be serviced. Can you estimate the tune-up cost please. Do I need to transport the mower? I live in Opelika near the high school on Hwy 51. I’m on a very fixed income and need to plan $ accordingly.

Service stated they see fluid that has leaked but cannot find the leak. I got home, moved two piles of dirt and the hydraulic fluid is leaking from the same area. I have taken a total of 5 hours of vacation time to bring the unit for service and pickup. I put the service date out to next week due to the impending weather and inability to take more time of work this week. Thanks. ","1578569676","true","new",
